**Findit** is designed to be a social media application where the main objective is to encourage users to **meet others in real life**. It aims to create the opposite experience of current social media apps by not encouraging prolonged time spent on the site. The application provides only the necessary tools to help users find places to go, meet people, and connect with each other. It is designed to manage user profiles, community interactions, and content creation within the platform. 

**FindIt's** database is built using **MySQL**, a powerful relational database management system that supports the application's data storage and management needs. An **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** is also provided for a visual representation of the database structure.
